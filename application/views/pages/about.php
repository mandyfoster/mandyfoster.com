                <p>Web applications and database systems are my game, as well as learning and implementing multiple coding languages. I'm currently located in the Seattle area and am interested in finding a great company (or small web team) to kick butt with. </p>

                <p>As a web developer I am able to build a web presence from the ground up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (also using the jQuery library), PHP and MySQL. I also have experience using both WordPress and the CodeIgniter Framework, and have been actively utilizing a version control system (GitHub). I'm just a hard-working, fast-learning, detail-oriented coder who can work diligently on her own, or with a few folks (I'm also familiar with being on an Agile Development Team).</p>
                
                <p>Attending Seattle Central College has allowed me to gain the skills possible to create intriquit puzzles of code that fit together into an appealing display of data. There I also took courses on Adobe Illustrator, the importance of Typography, using Content Management Systems and more.
